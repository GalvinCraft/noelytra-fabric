# No Elytras
No Elytras is a Minecraft Mod for Fabric 1.21 that prevents everyone on a server from having an elytra in their inventory!

Please be aware that running on a Fabric server is supported, but can lead to potential de-sync issues

**Note**: It *does not* remove elytras from being naturally generated, such as in end ships, mainly for compatibility purposes with other mods, but it will automatically delete it from player's inventories whenever they acquire it!
